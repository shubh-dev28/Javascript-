    // A DOM event is simply a signal that something happened on a web page. like A user clicking a button, Typing inside an input field, Submitting a form, Moving the mouse, Pressing a keyboard key. basically any form of user interaction with webpage happens.

    // An event means an action or occurrence detected by the browser.The browser keeps watching what the user is doing. Whenever something happens, it generates an event.

    // there are event name for events. Events allow JavaScript to say - “When this happens → do this action.”. When button is clicked → show message
    // Basic Flow of Events = User Action → Event Triggered → JavaScript Runs. telling the browser “If this event happens, run this code.”. 

    // Inline Event Handling (First and Basic Method). when button clicked, message will appear on console. onclick is an event attribute that listens for a click event. When clicked → JavaScript inside it runs. multiple click will trigger the event multiple times. we can also write multiple JS statement using ; . So an event can trigger many actions. 
    // it is a good idea to do as an experiment, but is not scalable. mixing html and js.
